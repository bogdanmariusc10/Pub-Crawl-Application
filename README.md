# Pub Crawl
Pub Crawl is a mobile application designed to enhance the nightlife experience in Bucharest. Developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, the app integrates two powerful APIs—Gemini AI and OpenStreetMap (OSMaps)—to help users discover and plan personalized pub crawls with ease. The app has a sleek and intuitive interface that focuses primarily on the interaction with the "Pub Guide," powered by Gemini AI.

### Features
Chat with the Pub Guide: The central feature of the app is a conversational window that allows users to ask Gemini AI (the Pub Guide) for personalized recommendations. Whether you're looking for pubs with rock music, cozy outdoor seating, or a laid-back ambiance, the Pub Guide can find the perfect spots for you in Bucharest. You can ask about specific preferences like "pubs with live music" or "places with a nice atmosphere" and get curated lists of suggestions.

Itinerary List: Once you get the recommendations, the Pub Guide adds the suggested venues to your personalized itinerary. The list is updated as you interact with the guide, and you can easily select which pub or restaurant you'd like to visit.

Interactive Map: As you finalize your pub crawl itinerary, the app generates an interactive map using OSMaps, placing a pin for each selected location. The map shows the shortest path from your current location to the pub, guiding you along the way with clear visual cues.

### Workflow
Get Recommendations: Ask the Pub Guide for suggestions based on specific criteria, such as location, music genre, or ambiance. The AI provides a list of suitable pubs, cafes, or restaurants in Bucharest.

Select Your Destination: After reviewing the recommendations, you select where you’d like to go. The app then adds the venue to your itinerary and marks it on the map.

Map Itinerary: Once your destination is set, the app calculates and displays the shortest walking route between your current location and the selected venue. A line is drawn on the map connecting these points, helping you visualize the distance and plan your route.

Explore More: If you'd like to visit more places, you simply repeat the process. Each time you add a new location, the app updates the map by drawing additional lines, creating a connected itinerary of pub crawl destinations.

Visual Feedback: As you explore different options, the app provides real-time updates to the list of locations and the map, ensuring a seamless, dynamic experience.

### Technology Stack
Kotlin: The app is developed using Kotlin, which provides a robust and efficient platform for Android development. Jetpack Compose, Kotlin’s modern UI toolkit, is used to create a responsive and visually appealing interface.

Gemini AI: The heart of the app’s recommendation engine is powered by Gemini AI, which uses natural language processing to understand user requests and offer highly relevant pub and restaurant recommendations.

OSMaps: The app utilizes the OpenStreetMap API to provide an interactive map experience. OSMaps helps users find the shortest path between their location and selected pubs, ensuring easy navigation throughout Bucharest.
